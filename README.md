# shopping-list-dom

A modern shopping list application built with **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, using **DOM manipulation** and styled with **Bootstrap** for a clean UI.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Dynamically render shopping list items on page load  
- ➕ Add new items to the list  
- ☑️ Mark items as completed  
- ❌ Delete individual items  
- ✏️ Update existing items  
- 🔍 Filter items dynamically (All / Completed / Incomplete)  
- 💾 Persist data in `localStorage`  
- 🧹 Clear entire list and reset storage with a single button

---

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** – DOM manipulation, localStorage, event handling  
- **HTML** – Semantic markup  
- **CSS + Bootstrap** – Layout and responsive styling  

---

## 💡 How It Works

- The app loads predefined items or pulls from `localStorage`
- All list items are created and manipulated via JavaScript using DOM methods
- Add, delete, update, and complete actions update both UI and `localStorage`
- Filtering buttons show specific sets of items without reloading
- “Clear All” button removes items from both the UI and browser storage
